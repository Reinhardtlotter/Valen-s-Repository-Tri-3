## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ValenReynolds/Valen-s-Repository-Tri-3/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ValenReynolds/Valen-s-Repository-Tri-3/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### 5.1/2 Notes

Corrections for Calling Procedures Quiz
Q1 I put A and C. It was C and D. I selected A because procedural abstraction helps hide details. So I thought it would be easier to understand how to prevent stealing intellectual property of other programmers. D is correct because procedures that are created to solve subproblems of a larger problem are called by name.
Q4 The answer I chose B is comparing the score to the amount it should be increased by. But it should be compared to the limit like in the the correct answer C
Q5 By code reuse in C I thought it meant stealing code but it means it's more convenient. But I should have chose the correct answer B because it doesn’t make code run faster
